Done:
- snap **4014006** (meta `8dde5b70`): `matchesRefused(syntax loaded: Result<void, Diagnostic[]>)` over a run-time
  `matchesRefusedAt(loaded, written, at)`. On `Error(ds)` it records one block per `Diagnostic` (`refused …`, `at …`, `label …`
  when there is one), one blank line between blocks, under subject `refused`, through the engine's path rule, `botopink-snap 1`
  and `.new` flow. On `Ok` the test fails with `snapshots: <path> compiled - matchesRefused expects a refused file`. `written` is
  the load call as the test wrote it (`compiler.text`) — `Result<void, Diagnostic[]>` carries no path, so the failure takes the
  call's first string literal. Cell `conformance/test/snap_matches_refused/` (a parse error with its label, a type mismatch;
  the `.new` on a changed refusal and the compiled file's failure proved by running — the test runner has no expected-failure
  form), and front 166's `snap_matches_refused-784/` draft. README, AGENTS and `conformance/docs.md` name 784's call.
- meta `250faf81` — mt-0055: `poolRelease` takes the lock (unless its own shell holds it), a field read from a vanished lease
  is empty and counts as 0 or the file is skipped. `scripts/gate-test.sh` gains the race through the test-only
  `BOTOPINK_POOL_SCAN_DELAY`: red on the parent with exactly the three errors reported, green after. 163 s14 records it.

Running: nothing.

Next (machine 2, 785's chain): B-158's new row — `botopink test` leaves a loaded file and its `mod` tree out of the package
as `botopink build` does (today a test package whose loaded cases sit under `src/` reports each as a failed module, so
snap's cell keeps them in `cases/`); then B-157 piece 5, whose packages call `compiler.load("src/cases/<case>/main.bp")`.

Blocking — for machine 1 (144):
- beam: `try loaded catch { ds -> …; return }` inside a run-time function makes `matchesRefusedAt/3` fail with `bad_type`
  (B-158's open `try … catch` row; snap reads the `Result` with `case` meanwhile).
- erlang and beam print a `panic` raised in a test as `{error,…}`; commonJS prints the plain message. New, not rowed.
- the module-qualified `snap.matchesRefused(...)` was not tried (B-156's last box); the cell imports `matchesRefused` bare.
