Done: `botopink cell check conformance/` on feat `849464f6e` (main checkout's compiler, built at `2ad19d40e`): 964 checked,
954 passed, 10 failed.

- **New red (yours, wasm):** `decisions-taken/numeric_literal_suffixes-247/run`, case `numeric_suffix_positions` on wasm is
  refused "the wasm backend would narrow this `i64` value to an `i32` slot it does not fit" at `mod.bp:91:19`
  (`val grown = case 1l { 1l -> 10l + 1l; _ -> 0l; };`), so the packed `main` prints nothing on wasm. The same refusal
  as draft 121's `PortError.TooBig(value: n)` (m2-0032). Not bisected; the compiler commits since the last green run are
  B-149's (`b290836e4`, `f12595539`, `84114de27`).
- Known, already named: `fs_asset_opens_as_file` (538), `fs_file_handle` (540).
- The seven `conformance/test/*` lines are not reds: those suites are checked by `botopink test --json`, not `cell check`.

Running: nothing. Blocking: nothing.
